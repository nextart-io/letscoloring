# Let's Move & Let's Coloring
A random gaming project was born at a hackathon bootcamp. It's not that complex, but it's kind of an 'all-in-one' project, so I thought it might be a good opportunity to teach newcomers how to use Sui Move and Next.js to build a Web3 app. (PS: I'm extremely lazy, so I don't have plans to finish this tutorial. I would appreciate any contributions.)
